What is RDRS?
---
Russian Drug Reviews corpus (RDRS) is a Russian-language annotated corpus consisting of medicine reviews posed by Internet users from the [Otzovik web site](https://otzovik.com/), with complex named entity recognition (NER) labeling of pharmaceutically relevant entities, and their relations.
<p align="center"><img src=./assets/annotation_example.png></p>

This is the third version of the corpus (or RDRS-3800), which includes 3,821 reviews. About the previous versions (RDRS-1600 and RDRS-2800), you can read at [link](https://sagteam.ru/en/med-corpus/)).

The main specifications of our corpus are shown in [Statistics section](#statistics).

Information about the data structure, detailed description of the fields and an example for a document from the dataset are presented in [Data Format](#data-format) and [Data Fields](#data-fields) sections.

The materials about annotation procedure described in [Dataset Creation section](#dataset-creation).

Application of the dataset for different tasks is discussed in [Supported Tasks section](#supported-tasks).

Getting Started
---
We've prepared a bash script to help you get started with the dataset.

To download the dataset you need to go to the repository directory ("./RDRS/") and run at cmd:
```bash
mkdir ./data
. get_data.sh
```

Alternatively, you can follow the steps:
1. Download the data archive [at link](https://sagteam.ru/RDRS/RDRS_v3_folds.tar.gz):
```bash
mkdir ./data
wget "https://sagteam.ru/RDRS/RDRS_v3_folds.tar.gz" -P ./data/
```
2. Extract the data by using the command:
```bash
tar -xzvf ./data/RDRS_v3_folds.tar.gz -C ./data/
```
3. (Optional) Remove the archive:
```bash
rm -f ./data/RDRS_v3_folds.tar.gz
```

After that you can find the data at "./RDRS/data/" directory.

Data Format
---
The data is presented in json format as a list of documents, where each document is a dictionary with keys: "text_id", "text", "entities", "relations", "coreference". For a detailed description of these keys and nested dictionary items, see below in the [Data Fields section](#data-fields).

An example of a document from the dataset is shown in file: ["sample_doc.json"](./assets/sample_doc.json).

## Data fields
First level tags:
- __text_id__ - review id;
- __text__ - review text;
- __entities__ - a list containing data about annotated mentions;
- __relations__ - a list containing data about relations between mentions;
- __coreference__ - a dictionary containing coreference annotation data.

Each element of the __entities__ list has a dictionary structure, where the key is the entity number, and the value is a dictionary describing this entity. A detailed description of the types is presented in the markup description on the website https://sagteam.ru/en/med-corpus/annotation/. To describe entities, dictionaries with the following fields are used (the [__field__] field means that it may be absent):
 - __entity_id__ - mention id.
 - __xmiID__ - alternate mention id assigned by the Webanno annotation system when exporting in xmi format.
 - __spans__ - a list in which information is stored about passages in which the entity is mentioned, each element of the list is a dictionary with fields __begin__ and __end__ (end not inclusive), which indicate the indexes of the span boundary.
 - __text__ - the text of the mention, composed of all spans specified in the __spans__ field.
 - __MedEntityType__ - main type of the mention, one of: Medication, Disease, ADR, Note.
 - [__DisType__] - Disease mention subtype. Field can be absent if __MedEntityType__ is not Disease.
 - [__MedType__] - Medication mention subtype. Field can be absent if __MedEntityType__ is not Medication.
 - [__medform_standart__] - standardized name for the form of the drug. The field is present if MedType==Drugform.
 - [__MedFrom__] - whether the drug is distributed in Russia (Domestic) or only abroad (Foreign). The field is only present if __MedType__ == Drugname.
 - [__ATC__] - anatomical-therapeutic-chemical classification code (if __MedType__==Drugname or __MedType__==Drugclass).
 - [__MKB10__] - ICD-10 classification code (if __DisType__==Diseasename). 
 - [__MedDRA__] - Preferred term from MedDRA (if __MedEntityType__==ADR or __MedEntityType__==Disease and __DisType__==Indication). If an entity allows several normalization options, the corresponding concepts are separated by "|".
 - __Context__ - a list indicating which contexts the mention belongs to in the review. 
 - __tag__ - list of tags. Tag is a combination of __MedEntityType__ and subtype.

Each element of the __relations__ list has a dictionary structure with the following fields::
__first_entity__, __second_entity__, __relation_type__, __relation_class__
- __first_entity__ - a dictionary that describes one of the mentions in a relation
- __second_entity__ - a dictionary that describes one of the mentions in a relation
- __relation_type__ - relation type, one of:'ADR_Medication:MedTypeDrugname',
 'Disease:DisTypeDiseasename_Disease:DisTypeIndication',
 'Medication:MedTypeDrugname_Disease:DisTypeDiseasename',
 'Medication:MedTypeDrugname_Medication:MedTypeSourceInfodrug'
- __relation_class__ - relationship class, takes the value 1 if the entities have a common label in the __Context__ field (there is a relationship between the entities), or 0 if the entities are not united by the same context (no relationship).

In the __coreference__ coreference chains a specified by dictionary with 2 fields:
- __mentions__ contains list of mention spans described by its boundaries in the text __startPos__ and __endPos__;
- __clusters__ —Åcontains a list of chains (clusters). each chain in this list of mention indexes from __mentions__ that are coreferent.

## Statistics
The corpus contains:
- 3821 documents
- 11812 mentions of drugnames linked to 604 ATC codes;
- 4934 mentions of diseasenames linked to 428 ICD-10 codes;
- 5050 mentions of ADR linked to 615 unique MedDRA terms;
- and 7456 indications linked to 627 unique MedDRA terms;
More detailed statistics can be found on our [website](https://sagteam.ru/en/med-corpus/stats/)

## Dataset creation
Mention labeling for the review texts has been performed by a group of four annotators using a guide developed jointly by machine learning experts and pharmacists. Two annotators were qualified pharmacists, and the two others were students with pharmaceutical education.
The process of creation of this dataset describet in the article (please cite it if you are using this dataset):
